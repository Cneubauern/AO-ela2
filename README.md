eLa2: Fractals, due date: 11/19/2014 8:00 am

In this e-Learning activity you are requested to generate three fractals; two based on the function star(..) and a third one based on some of these strategies to create fractals.

a) Fractal 1 and fractal 2 should look pretty close to these examples:

Fractal 1	Fractal 2
b) For the third fractal you are requested to modify the function star(..) as you wish, i.e. to obtain one fractal of your own. Show your creativity and try to put together some of these strategies for fractals to create a piece of computing art (for example fractal landscapes or abstract fractal art). For comparison purposes, avoid getting into Mandelbrot sets or the like.

Add an entry to the glossary with the name you want to give to your own fractal (third fractal) and post in this glossary entry your three fractals.
